                <p>
                  The Crypt started as a living space for a group of musicians.
                  They would jam at all hours of day and night, frequently
                  inviting friends and local artists to join them during
                  sessions.
                </p>

                <h3>2020 - Community Expansion</h3>
                <p>
                  As word spread, The Crypt became a community hub, hosting
                  weekly music events, and attracting talent from all over the
                  region. Our operations evolved, opening up the backyard,
                  living room, and downstairs bar.

                <h3>2021 - Official Recognition</h3>
                <p>
                  The Crypt became locally recognized as an indie hotspot,
                  growing in popularity thanks to word-of-mouth and local show
                  group chats. We began our entry stamp system, aiming to better
                  regulate max capacity.

                <h3>2022 - Beyond Music</h3>
                <p>
                  Broadening its scope, The Crypt began to include other forms
                  of art, such as visual exhibitions, spoken word, and drag
                  shows. We hosted our first ever drag performance, and it was a
                  resounding success. The support and warmth of the community
                  has helped make drag a staple of the Crypt experience.
